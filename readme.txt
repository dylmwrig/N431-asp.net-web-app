ASP.net e-commerce web application Made by a group of four.

Somewhat large program which required knowledge of C#, web programming, usage of ASP.net libraries, and heavy database usage.

For this project we consulted with an actual client who worked with a STEM outreach program. This application was designed to be an all in one STEM camp registration application, complete with administration tools. The nature of learning the technology while developing the application and working with multiple people plus a client gave this project a similar feel to real world development.
